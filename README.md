# Task6_ML-AL_KNNClassification
I have completed my 6th task of AI & ML INTERNSHIP of Elevate Lab.In this projec i worked on the Iris Species Classification project using machine learning
🔹 Sepal Length
🔹 Sepal Width
🔹 Petal Length
🔹 Petal Width

🔍 Project Highlights:
✅ Data Cleaning & Visualization using Pandas and Seaborn
✅ Trained models: Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM
✅ Evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix
✅ Achieved high accuracy in predicting the correct species! 🧠📈

📁 Tools Used: Python | Pandas | Seaborn | Scikit-learn

📊 Key Steps:
Data Import & Exploration:
Loaded the dataset using pandas and explored basic statistics and structure.
Visualised relationships using seaborn pair plots and box plots to understand feature distribution.

Preprocessing:
Checked for null values.
Encoded species labels if needed.

Model Training:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Trained different classification models like:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Evaluation:
Compared results to select the best model for classification.

The model(s) achieved high accuracy in classifying the Iris species based on flower measurements, demonstrating the effectiveness of basic machine learning algorithms on small, structured datasets.
